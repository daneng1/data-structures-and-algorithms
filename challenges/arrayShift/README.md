# Challenge Summary
Insert and shift an array in middle at index
## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added.

## Approach & Efficiency
At first I tried this using .splice(), but realized that we can't use methods. Then I used a For loop to iterate through the array and insert the new number at the middle index.
